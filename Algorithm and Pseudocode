Algorithm
User is given 3 lives, and 60 seconds
User presses start, timer begins to count down
CPU generates random addition or subtraction question
User is asked to solve question
If the answer is correct then give the user 100 points
If it is incorrect user loses 1 life
Continue generating questions until user has 0 lives left
Tell user they lost and show final score

If the timer hits 0, the user is sent to the game over screen, regardless of lives


Pseudocode
Int interval, lives = 3, points, answer;
3 labels, jl, score, time
1 text field userIn
2 buttons start & check
1 timer timer

GameMain(){
	Declare all the buttons labels and text fields
	Set their bounds
	Add them to the program, and make adjustments to the frame itself
}

Action performed{
	if(the user presses start){
		Calls countdown(), and generate the first question
	}if the user presses check {
		If user input = answer
		Then give the user 100 points, reset the text field, and generate another question

		If user input != answer
		The user loses 1 life, and a new question is generated
	}
	If lives = 0 then gameOver
}

Int Question generation
Int num1, num2, operation, answer
Randomly generate values for num1 and num 2 between 1 and 50
Randomly generate value for operation between 1 and 0
If operation = 1 then answer = num1 + num2
Set text of label to num1 “+” num2 = ?
If operation = 0 then answer = num1 - num2
Set text of label to num1 “-” num2 = ?
In both outcomes Return answer

gameOver()
Remove all elements except jl, 
jl.setText(Game over, final score (their score));

countdown() {
Interval  = 60
Declare interval object
If interval == 1{ 
gameOver()
}
Interval--
Set text of timer to the current time

Main method
